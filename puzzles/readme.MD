The puzzles are from Mensa Number Puzzles copyright 1993 by Harold Gale. There are 16 different types, of which several weren't easily given to calculation.

DONE OR JUST NEED DATA ENTRY:

* 1 = down-left to upper-right traversal (8 is identical)
* 2 = number piece puzzle
* 5 = sum 4 numbers to a given number
* 7 = graph traversal
* 10 = find divisors (but stupid)
* 11 = magic square (could try for intelligence/guesses)
* 15 = lock / reverse engineering

TO DO:
* 3 = traversal from center
* 6 = system of equations and unknowns
* 13 = scales (equations and unknowns sort of)

WON'T DO:
* 4 = number pattern recognition
* 9 = number pattern recognition
* 14 = number pattern recognition
* 12 = planet rotation
* 16 = equation-solving (multiple solutions, not worth it)
