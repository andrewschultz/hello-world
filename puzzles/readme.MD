The puzzles are from Mensa Number Puzzles copyright 1993 by Harold Gale. There are 16 different types, of which several weren't easily given to calculation.

DONE OR JUST NEED DATA ENTRY OF ALL PUZZLES:

* m1-8.py 1 = down-left to upper-right traversal (8 is identical)
* m2.py = number piece puzzle
* m3.py = traversal from center to get certain sum
* m5.py = sum 4 numbers to a given number
* m6.py = system of equations and unknowns
* m7.py = graph traversal
* m10.py = find divisors (but stupid)
* m11.py = magic square (could try for intelligence/guesses)
* m13.py = scales (equations and unknowns sort of)
* m14.py = number pattern recognition (a / b / c -> d)
* m15.py = lock / reverse engineering

TO DO:

WON'T DO:
* 4 = number pattern recognition in grid, boring
* 9 = number pattern recognition in grid, boring
* 12 = planet rotation (breaks down to fraction arithmetic)
* 16 = equation-solving (multiple solutions, easy but not programmable)
