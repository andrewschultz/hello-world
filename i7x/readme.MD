This is a directory with pretty much one file. It can be deleted/moved.

* dbh.py creates debug hacking for any file, so random stuff is tested.
** Perhaps an easier way to do this is just to set a table's random seed to (n-1) but if the first two entries are fixed it is still useful to test e.g. "A B" "An E" can be (A B|An E) in a regex. But my random table tests largely focus on looping.
