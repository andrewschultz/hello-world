Part 1 - definitions and globals

chapter defining a hint-topic

a hint-topic is a kind of thing. a hint-topic is usually privately-named. [This is just so that we don't have any disambiguation.]

[hint topics should always be given a printed name.]

a hint-topic can be active, inactive or rule-dependent. a hint-topic is usually inactive.

a hint-topic can be unfinished, paged-through or all-seen. a hint-topic is usually unfinished.

a hint-topic has a rule called the avail-rule. avail-rule of a hint-topic is usually the never-hint rule.

a hint-topic has a table-name called the hint-list.

a hint-topic has a number called table-row.

a hint-topic has a number called reference-number.

a hint-topic can be critical or noncritical. a hint-topic is usually critical.

section hint styles

hint-style is a kind of value. the hint-styles are all-hint, flex-hint, and one-hint. [The three styles work as follows: all-hint shows all previous hints in a topic, all the time, when the player types H. One-hint shows only the most recent hint topic. Flex-hint is a combination of the two: it will show the most recent hint if the player asked for a hint the turn before, but it will show them all otherwise. The player can switch among these styles, but flexible hinting is recommended as a default and is set below.

The author may change this with a "when play begins" rule. For instance, if they have relatively small hint topics, then all-hint is reasonable, or if they want to use very minimal text space, one-hint is reasonable, though it would be polite to notify the player of the HA command.]

current-hint-style is a hint-style that varies. current-hint-style is usually flex-hint.

temp-hint-style is a hint-style that varies. temp-hint-style is usually flex-hint. [this variable should not be changed! It is used with HL and HA, which are commands that give the player the last hint and all hints in a topic, respectively, for one turn only, hence the "temp" prefix.]

chapter stubs

to say h-bold:
	say "[bold type]H[roman type]";

to say ha-b:
	say "[bold type]HA[roman type]";

to say hl-b:
	say "[bold type]HL[roman type]";

to say hb-b:
	say "[bold type]HINT BLOCK[roman type]";

To skip upcoming rulebook break: (- say__pc = say__pc | PARA_NORULEBOOKBREAKS; -).

this is the always-hint rule:
	the rule succeeds;

this is the never-hint rule:
	the rule fails;

definition: a hint-topic (called ht) is available:
	if hint-crit-only is true and ht is noncritical, decide no;
	if ht is active, decide yes;
	if ht is inactive, decide no;
	if ht is rule-dependent:
		skip upcoming rulebook break;
		follow the avail-rule of ht;
		if the rule succeeded, decide yes;
		decide no;

to activate (ht - a hint-topic):
	now ht is active;

to deactivate (ht - a hint-topic):
	now ht is inactive;

section debugging stubs

[these can't quite go in part 6, because we need some way to determine if hint debug is turned on, and there are debug-print commands in some major functions. Hint-debug should never be altered except in not-for-release sections.]

to debug-say (x - text):
	if hint-debug is true:
		say "[x][line break]";

hint-debug is a truth state that varies.

chapter globals

hint-block is a truth state that varies.

hint-local-block is a truth state that varies.

hint-crit-only is a truth state that varies. [The default is false, which means we print all hint topics, even non-critical ones. However, it is okay to change this. It can be changed with HINT CRIT.]

in-hint is a truth state that varies.

null-topic is a hint-topic. null-topic is inactive. [this is so that last-topic-hinted does not point to the first hint topic the programmer describes. That would cause bugs.] printed name is "the null topic".

section Variables the Programmer can Change

hint-topic-end-note is a truth state that varies. [This toggles whether or not we give the player a note when they hit the end. While the (8/8) clues are adequate, it can be useful if the player forgets.]

mention-critical-hints is a truth state that varies. [This has no effect on which hint topics are displayed. It merely determines whether HINT VERBOSE prompts the player to try HINT CRIT. It's potentially fiddly, but it can be set to true when
1. there are optional hint-topics
2. the author wants to make sure the player knows they can shut hints off
It should be left false if there are no optional hint-topics, because then HINT CRIT has no effect.
You can either disable the rule below or force mention-critical-hints to false in your main program if you want to. However, it is probably polite to let the player know about non-critical hints if you use them.
]

when play begins (this is the mention existing noncritical hints in verbose hinting rule):
	if number of noncritical hint-topics > 0:
		now mention-critical-hints is true;
	continue the action;

hide-auto is a truth state that varies. hide-auto is usually false. [This is another fine-tuning boolean that toggles HINT VERBOSE behavior. It determines whether the user sees the "HINT AUTO" documentation and should probably be set to false in most cases. However, if the programmer is confident there will be more than one hint topic at all times, then it can be set to true. If activated, it gives a warning that HINT AUTO is likely useless, since auto-hinting can occur when there is only one topic available.]

confirm-hint-block is a truth state that varies. confirm-hint-block is usually true; [this has the player confirm HINT BLOCK for a session. It's polite to keep it true, though the player can still undo.]

Part 2 - hinting

chapter displaying hint topics

hinting is an action out of world.

understand the command "hint/hints/topics/topic" as something new.

understand "hint" and "hints" and "topics" and "topic" as hinting.

init-hint is a truth state that varies.

to say hint-block-total:
	say "Hints are now completely blocked for this session. However, after you restore any saved game, [bold type]HINT ON[roman type] will recover them";

to decide whether (nu - a number) is irrelevant:
	if nu is 66 or nu is 98, decide no;
	if nu is 78 or nu is 110, decide no;
	if nu is 89 or nu is 121, decide no;
	decide yes;

carry out hinting (this is the top level hint request rule) :

	if naht is 0:

	now topics-sorted-yet is true;

			try expounding raht instead;
		if hint-auto-warn is false:

			say "[if naht > 1][count]) [else]* [end if][ht] ([table-row of ht] of [number of rows in hint-list of ht] hints seen[if last-topic-hinted is HT], current active topic[end if])[line break]";

chapter hint blocking

hintblocking is an action out of world.

understand "hint block" as hintblocking.

carry out hintblocking (this is the block hints but verify first rule):
	if hint-block is true:
		say "Hints are already blocked. You will need to restore a saved game or restart to undo this." instead;
	if confirm-hint-block is true:
		say "Blocking hints can be a drastic step. For instance, if undo is disabled, you'll need to restore a saved game. Would you like to confirm hint blocking?";

	say "Hints are now off, but not permanently blocked. You can restore them with [bold type]HINT ON[roman type].";
	the rule succeeds;

Part 3 - topics and expounding

accessing hint topics by number is an action applying to one number.

understand the command "t" as something new.

understand "t" as a mistake ("[if hint-block is true][all-blocked][else if hint-local-block is true][temp-blocked][else][bold type]T[roman type] alone doesn't work. You need to give a number. If you wish to access the topic's next hint, you can just type H[end if].")

understand "t [text]" and "topic [text]" as a mistake ("[if hint-block is true][all-blocked][else if hint-local-block is true][temp-blocked][else]You can only use a number when accessing a topic. So TOPIC 2, T 2 and even T2 work, but TOPIC TWO does not[end if].").

understand "t [number]" and "topic [number]" and "topics [number]" as accessing hint topics by number.

after reading a command (this is the avoid odd errors but allow numbers rule):
	if the player's command matches the regular expression "^<0-9>":
		let XX be indexed text;
		let XX be the player's command in lower case;
		change the text of the player's command to "t [xx]";
	continue the action;

after reading a command (this is the zap out of world actions for in-hint rule) :
	unless the player's command matches the regular expression "^(h|ha|hl)\b":
		now in-hint is false; [this may not be perfect; if HINT goes to [h-bold], then we have an odd test case. ??]
	continue the action;

topics-sorted-yet is a truth state that varies.

last-topic-hinted is a hint-topic that varies.

carry out accessing hint topics by number (this is the check for topic rule) :
	if hint-block is true:
		say "[all-blocked]." instead;
	if hint-local-block is true:
		say "[temp-blocked]." instead;
	if topics-sorted-yet is false:
		say "You can't choose a hint topic until you've accessed the list of topics. Type [hi-b] to see the available hint topics." instead;
	let naht be number of available hint-topics;
	if number understood < 1 or number understood > naht:
		if naht is 1:
			say "There's only one hint topic available." instead;
		say "You need a number from 1 to [naht]." instead;
	repeat with Q running through hint-topics:
		if reference-number of Q is number understood:
			try expounding Q instead;
	say "There should be something with that number, but there isn't." instead;

expounding is an action applying to one visible thing.

definition: a hint-topic (called my-top) is repeat-viewed: [this is so a paged-through hint topic can be printed all the way through without "you saw this before."]
	if table-row of my-top is 1, decide no;
	if my-top is unfinished, decide no;
	if my-top is all-seen, decide yes;
	if my-top is paged-through and temp-hint-style is all-hint, decide yes; [the first statement should be trivially true, since it's the only state of three remaining, but just for posterity, if we add another state]
	if my-top is paged-through and current-hint-style is all-hint, decide yes; [the first statement should be trivially true, since it's the only state of three remaining, but just for posterity, if we add another state]
	decide no;

to decide whether show-all-hints:
	if temp-hint-style is all-hint, decide yes;
	if temp-hint-style is one-hint, decide no; [temp-hint-style is very local and thus trumps current-hint-style]
	if current-hint-style is all-hint, decide yes;
	if current-hint-style is one-hint, decide no;
	if current-hint-style is flex-hint and in-hint is true, decide no; [in other words, you've been going through hints, so you will only see the last one]
	decide yes. [the final case is flex-hint current style and in-hint is false]

carry out expounding (this is the look for topic's next available hint rule) :
	if noun is not a hint-topic:
		say "Oops! You should not be expounding a non-hint-topic." instead;

	if table-row of noun < number of rows in hint-list of noun:

In-Line Topical Hints ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

PURPOSE

In-Line Topical Hints is meant to circumnavigate hint menus, which can break immersion for the player. Also, it tries to keep unwieldy hint menus under control. While it offers progressive hinting, it also tries not to overwhelm the reader with text. The basic use case is that a player asks for hints and is given a list of potential topics. Then he types the topic number, and he can type H to see the next hint. By default, hints are shown one at a time if the player requests them continually, but if the player performs a few actions and comes back, the whole list is shown again. This is what the extension terms flexible hinting. The programmer can also force the default to showing all hints in a topic or only the last one, but the player can override these with special commands.

There are two ways for a programmer to decide whether to display a specific hint topics. You can either label it active to inactive, or you can make it rule-based and create a rule whether you can display them. If you are comfortable with rules, it may be smoother for you to establish a rule (e.g. if escape hatch is visited and typed-security-code is false).

One special case worth mentioning is if there is only one available hint topic. HINT AUTO lets the player toggle whether to skip to the hint in the topic or to avoid spoilers. The default is to avoid spoilers, but the programmer can change this by setting the hint-auto flag to true.

So if hint-auto is set to true, and a player tries hints, and there is only one available hint topic, the game chooses that. If not, the player is offered an option from one to the available number of hint topics. Whichever number they choose, they see the next hint they haven't seen yet. Once they choose that option, H goes to the next clue in the topic. It also, by default, only shows the next clue. The player can change this behavior if they want, but the point is to make the hints as unintrusive as possible.

One fine-tuning feature is that you are able to create a show-rule in a hint table. If this is left blank, the hint will always be shown. However, it can be changed to eliminate a hint the player should already know about. Let's take potential hints from a formerly popular RPG. While conditional text is possible, the player may appreciate having longer hint topics cut down as much as possible.

	"You still need the bell, book and candle before continuing. That hint topic should be available."	--	need-all-three rule [this hint only appears if you're missing one of the three items]
	"You still need a party of eight players for the journey through the abyss. That hint topic should be available."	--	need-all-eight rule [similarly, this only appears if your party is less than 8 people]
	"You still need the mystic weapons and mystic armor. That hint topic should be available."	--	need-weapons-and-armor rule [finally, a check to make sure # of equipped weapons/armor + # in pool each > 8]
	"[if have-everything]Okay, you're ready to enter the Abyss and get the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom[else]It's a long way down, and you'll be frustrated if you get to level 8 without auto-save and get rejected. Still, let's go ahead[end if]." [have-everything is checking the first three rules all fail. I'm eliminating the pseudocode because that gets nitpicky.]

Another fine-tuning feature is to label certain hints topics noncritical. If the player just wants to win the game, they may not want to be distracted by a side quest this time around. By default, no hint topics are noncritical, but adjusting the hint-crit-only flag (default false) can change the default behavior, which is showing all hints. HINT CRIT will let the player toggle this at any time.

Also, feel free to modify the hint-usage and HINT VERBOSE documentation. I'd be interested how it could be tweaked.

Second of all, there are things you may wish to change and variables you may wish to set in a When Play Begins rule. These variables are listed below. There doesn't seem to be much reason to change them afterwards.

DEFAULTS POTENTIALLY WORTH CHANGING

See "Section Variables the player can change" in the source for this.

DEBUGGING WHICH HINTS APPEAR WHEN

One of the big problems with a hint system is that your testers can't tell you what's being hinted, when. Or if they do, it sort of spoils the game.

Some basic debugging is provided with In-Line Topical Hints so that you are able to verify a test walkthrough works. HINTDEBUG is a not-for-release command that prints out all the topics available every move. This is probably more useful for the programmer than a player, who may get overwhelmed with the text.

RECORDHINTS is available for the tester if they wish to create a text file of topics they would've seen. It is Glulx-only, since it requires output to a file. The format is >>(command): (List of topics).

ALLHINTNAMES simply shows all the hint names, so you can see if there are any egregious duplicates, or if one sticks out as out-of-place.

CREDITS

I'd like to thank Alice Grove, who tested this extension for inclusion in Delphina's House, which you should play, even if you ignore the hinting. Her suggestions and bug reports (technical and aesthetic) helped me focus on the big picture and also reminded me of scattered features I'd written up for myself but never written out formally.

PREVIOUS VERSIONS

1/150214 was part of Delphina's House and featured basic debugging, HA/HL and the basic commands.
2/150418 added debugging exported to a file.
